# Programming-Style Introspective
To further my knowledge in programming styles, this repository solves the term frequency problem through the introspective style using JavaScript.<br>

In this repository there is also a file that solves the term frequency problem using introspective and python. Such file was extracted from the repository https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style from Crista Lopes. <br>

Since I used JavaScript to code the solution, the instalation to node will be necessary to run the code. The download can be done through https://nodejs.org/en/download. <br>

I will be more than happy to chat about problems, suggestions, other language solutions through my email (leandro.kornelius@gmail.com). <br>

Thank you!
